# os
Nothing more than a little toy os to learn about low level stuff. Partially based off of https://ordoflammae.github.io/littleosbook

# Compiling
Run `make iso`. It will require gcc and nasm, and grub to compile.

# Running
Run `make qemu` in one terminal and `make gdb` in another. Qemu will not start until gdb attaches itself.
